Vehicle Management System is designed to manage a fleet of vehicles efficiently. It uses an enhanced linked list data structure for storing, searching, adding, updating, and sorting vehicle records. The application supports two vehicle types (Cars and Trucks), implements basic algorithms for sorting and searching, and uses object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

Key Features:

Vehicle Class: Abstract base class for all vehicle types (Car, Truck).
Car/Truck Classes: Derived classes from Vehicle representing specific types of vehicles, with overridden methods.
LinkedList Class: Manages nodes that hold vehicle records and supports basic operations like add, remove, search, and sort.
CustomerManager Class: Manages a list of customers who use the vehicle search operations.
Console UI: Provides a user-friendly command-line interface to interact with the system.
