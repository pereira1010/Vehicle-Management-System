1. You can create a fold to put all the code files in there. 
2. how to compile the files:
on the command line, put all the files with .cpp extention like this:
C:\Users\Thien\Desktop\test>g++ 
main.cpp Truck.cpp Car.cpp Node.cpp LinkedList.cpp CustomerManager.cpp Customer.cpp Test.cpp - o any name and enter

name is a placeholder for any name or label or character you prefer to use as the name for your compiled binary code generated by the compiler. After the files have been compiled, you can use that name to run the program. Ex, if your chosen executable file name is cap, then running the programme will look like this:

Here is an example what the user-inteface of the programme looks like 
g++ -o crap main.cpp Truck.cpp Car.cpp Node.cpp CustomerManager.cpp Customer.cpp Test.cpp LinkedList.cpp



C:\Users\Thien\Desktop\testb>cap

At present, the default output file "customer.txt" can be used to save the info
of only 1 person.Hence, only the 1st person's info , such as username, password and others are saved in the file when being refistered, other persons' info will not be saved in the file, and thus once they exit, they can not sign in with their username and password and have to provide them again. Only the 1st person can sign in with the registered username and password. If you want to to change the username and password, you will have to delete the output file "customer.txt" created by the programme to let it generate a new output file with a different username and password for you.
